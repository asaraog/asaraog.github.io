For example, Uber, Amex and KhanAcademy find benefits with Golang.
To benchmark Golang&rsquo;s performance and runtime against Python and/or R, here are various cases:
Performing least squares regression of the Anscombe Quartet (1973) Computing summary statistics of the California Housing Prices (Miller 2015) Web crawling and scraping of Wikipedia Identifying anomalies in the MNIST dataset Least squares regression with Python and R The Golang implementation is benchmarked for runtime with a previous implementation by Miller (2015) in Python/R as a reference.]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image"><img loading="eager" src="/images/hugo-preview.png" alt="Building this website with Hugo" title="Building this website with Hugo" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"/></div>Partial image credit Why Golang? Static site generators such as Hugo were developed recently using Golang. Golang is a compiled language designed for today&rsquo;s multi-processor, scalable, high-performance systems. Other platforms have inherited dependency chains that can lead to infeasible build times. Realizing these benefits, Cloudfare recently migrated from Gatsby (a web framework based on JavaScript).
Demo website I first created a demo website using the Hugo Winston theme. This theme does have a Live Demo which made it simple to deploy onto Netlify.]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image"><img loading="eager" src="/images/concurrent.png" alt="Concurrency with Golang" title="Concurrency with Golang" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"/></div>What? Concurrency or concurrent processing is breaking up a single process into independent components to coordinate compute. It is based on the idea of CSP or Communicating Sequential Processes (Brookes, Hoare, and Roscoe 1984). In contrast to parallel processing, the paradigm here is shifted towards communication and splitting of independent processes instead of sharing memory. To communicate between different processes, Golang utilizes goroutines, which are similar to channels as described in CSP.]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image"><img loading="eager" src="/images/frontend.png" alt="Front-end software development using Golang" title="Front-end software development using Golang" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"/></div>What? In the world of web and desktop applications, frameworks for different software languages such as Rails for Ruby and Electron for JavaScript are popular. Analogous to Rails, Golang uses the Wails framework and offers the benefits of Golang&rsquo;s reported processing speed. Wails also uses the native rendering engine unlike Electron which uses an embedded browser. Furthermore, Wails integrates user interface (UI) frameworks such as React, Vue and Svelte.
To demo Golang&rsquo;s frontend capabilities, two projects are implemented here using Wails and Svelte:]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image"><img loading="eager" src="/images/mnist.png" alt="MNIST Dataset" title="MNIST Dataset" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"/></div>MNIST Dataset This project utilizes the The Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset which comprises of 60 thousand training observations and 10 thousand test observations of handwritten digits.
Image classification using neural networks with Python Due to the complexity of imaging data, connectionist network models or neural networks have been gaining significant interest in recent years. Python machine learning packages sklearn and keras have been especially useful for specifying neural network architectures.]]></description>
