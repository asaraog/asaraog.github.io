# Predicting Autism


## Predicting the Diagnosis of Autism using Classification Models based on fMRI
### Abstract

Autism spectrum disorder is a lifelong neurodevelopmental disorder that is diagnosed based on behavioral and social interaction patterns. Predictive algorithms provide a novel approach in identifying key neurological biomarkers and subsequent psychiatric diagnosis using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. This study analyzes a dataset collected from studies at 17 international locations as part of the **Autism Brain Imaging Dataset Exchange (ABIDE)**. To classify the medical images, we extract regional homogeneity scores and compare random forest models with convolutional neural networks. The accuracy for a five-fold cross validated random forest model and neural network having the highest validation score were found to be 0.57 and 0.54 respectively using the holdout test dataset.
