Proteins thus evolved for millions of years before being repurposed for human applications in the medical field, food and chemicals. CRISPR enzymes are emerging as a highly versatile workhorse for targeting of specific DNA sequences, useful in biomedicine and biotechnology. Exploring the vast space of possible protein sequences is intractable using traditional protein engineering approaches of rational design and directed evolution.]]></description>
