Bodyfat percentage is an important estimator for health. The most accurate method for measuring bodyfat is by underwater weighing which is time-intensive. Predictive analytics (linear regression) using indirect measurements offer a faster method to compute bodyfat percentage. This study analyzes bodyfat data determined by underwater weighing with their corresponding indirect measurements. To predict the bodyfat using these measurements, we compare a traditional linear model, regularized model, subset models (indicator, dichotomous, piecewise, polynomial), and feature engineering models (principal components analysis).]]></description>
