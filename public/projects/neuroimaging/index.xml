Abstract
Olfaction (sense of smell) and related structural abnormalities in the olfactory bulbs are among the first observed symptoms corelated with Alzhiemer’s disease (Esiri and Wilcock 1984; Thomann et al. 2009). The functional relationship between olfaction and the olfactory bulbs is poorly understood (Weiss et al. 2020). In the area of visual decoding, advances in machine learning using generative adversarial networks (GANs) have provided an unprecedented insight into neural decoding or the mapping of an individual brain’s responses and performance (Seeliger et al.]]></description>

Autism spectrum disorder is a lifelong neurodevelopmental disorder that is diagnosed based on behavioral and social interaction patterns. Predictive algorithms provide a novel approach in identifying key neurological biomarkers and subsequent psychiatric diagnosis using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. This study analyzes a dataset collected from studies at 17 international locations as part of the Autism Brain Imaging Dataset Exchange (ABIDE).]]></description>
