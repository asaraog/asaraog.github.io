Image classification using neural networks with Python Identifying anomalies using isolation forests with Golang, Python and R See my Github repository for further details.
Isolation forests are used as an unsupervised learning method to identify anomalies or outliers. It was introduced by Liu 2008 by observing that path lengths for anomalies were significantly SHORTER by averaging over many trees.]]></description>
