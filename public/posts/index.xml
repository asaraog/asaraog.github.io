Static site generators such as Hugo were developed recently using Golang. Golang is a compiled language designed for today&rsquo;s multi-processor, scalable, high-performance systems. Other platforms have inherited dependency chains that can lead to infeasible build times. Realizing these benefits, Cloudfare recently migrated from Gatsby (a web framework based on JavaScript).
Demo website I first created a demo website using the Hugo Winston theme. This theme does have a Live Demo which made it simple to deploy onto Netlify.]]></description>

For example, Uber, Amex and KhanAcademy find benefits with Golang.
To benchmark Golang&rsquo;s performance and runtime against Python and/or R, here are various cases:
Performing least squares regression of the Anscombe Quartet (1973) Computing summary statistics of the California Housing Prices (Miller 2015) Web crawling and scraping of Wikipedia Identifying anomalies in the MNIST dataset Least squares regression with Python and R The Golang implementation is benchmarked for runtime with a previous implementation by Miller (2015) in Python/R as a reference.]]></description>

School of Professional Studies, Northwestern University
Abstract
Olfaction (sense of smell) and related structural abnormalities in the olfactory bulbs are among the first observed symptoms corelated with Alzhiemer’s disease (Esiri and Wilcock 1984; Thomann et al. 2009). The functional relationship between olfaction and the olfactory bulbs is poorly understood (Weiss et al. 2020). In the area of visual decoding, advances in machine learning using generative adversarial networks (GANs) have provided an unprecedented insight into neural decoding or the mapping of an individual brain’s responses and performance (Seeliger et al.]]></description>

Due to the complexity of imaging data, connectionist network models or neural networks have been gaining significant interest in recent years. Python machine learning packages sklearn and keras have been especially useful for specifying neural network architectures.]]></description>

In the world of web and desktop applications, frameworks for different software languages such as Rails for Ruby and Electron for JavaScript are popular. Analogous to Rails, Golang uses the Wails framework and offers the benefits of Golang&rsquo;s reported processing speed. Wails also uses the native rendering engine unlike Electron which uses an embedded browser. Furthermore, Wails integrates user interface (UI) frameworks such as React, Vue and Svelte.
To demo Golang&rsquo;s frontend capabilities, two projects are implemented here using Wails and Svelte:]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image"><img loading="eager" src="/images/concurrent.png" alt="Concurrency with Golang" title="Concurrency with Golang" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"/></div>What? Concurrency or concurrent processing is breaking up a single process into independent components to coordinate compute. It is based on the idea of CSP or Communicating Sequential Processes (Brookes, Hoare, and Roscoe 1984). In contrast to parallel processing, the paradigm here is shifted towards communication and splitting of independent processes instead of sharing memory. To communicate between different processes, Golang utilizes goroutines, which are similar to channels as described in CSP.]]></description>

Bodyfat percentage is an important estimator for health. The most accurate method for measuring bodyfat is by underwater weighing which is time-intensive. Predictive analytics (linear regression) using indirect measurements offer a faster method to compute bodyfat percentage. This study analyzes bodyfat data determined by underwater weighing with their corresponding indirect measurements. To predict the bodyfat using these measurements, we compare a traditional linear model, regularized model, subset models (indicator, dichotomous, piecewise, polynomial), and feature engineering models (principal components analysis).]]></description>

Autism spectrum disorder is a lifelong neurodevelopmental disorder that is diagnosed based on behavioral and social interaction patterns. Predictive algorithms provide a novel approach in identifying key neurological biomarkers and subsequent psychiatric diagnosis using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. This study analyzes a dataset collected from studies at 17 international locations as part of the Autism Brain Imaging Dataset Exchange (ABIDE).]]></description>

Colon cancer is a significant public health concern and leading cause of death in the older human population. The healthcare burden can be significantly reduced with earlier detection and preventative measures. Although genetic information has been shown to be altered in the early stage of the disease, DNA sequencing data is highly dimensional and must be analyzed using predictive algorithms.]]></description>

College of Engineering, University of Wisconsin-Madison
Abstract
We know that amino acids are combined in sequence to constitute proteins for an undefined number of biological functions. Proteins thus evolved for millions of years before being repurposed for human applications in the medical field, food and chemicals. CRISPR enzymes are emerging as a highly versatile workhorse for targeting of specific DNA sequences, useful in biomedicine and biotechnology.]]></description>
