Here, Golang&rsquo;s performance and runtime is benchmarked against Python and/or R with various cases:

  <description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image"><img loading="eager" src="/images/hugo-preview.png" alt="Building this website with Hugo" title="Building this website with Hugo" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"/></div>Partial image credit Why? Golang is a compiled language designed for today&rsquo;s multi-processor, scalable, high-performance systems. Known for concurrent data processing, Uber uses Golang on the backend. Static site generators such as Hugo were developed recently using Golang. Other platforms have inherited dependency chains that can lead to infeasible build times. For example, Cloudfare recently migrated from Gatsby.

Concurrency is breaking up a single process into independent components and then making a plan on how they will compute. It is based on the idea of CSP or Communicating Sequential Processes (Brookes, Hoare, and Roscoe 1984). The paradigm here is shifted towards communication and splitting of independent processes instead of sharing memory in parallel processing. To communicate between different processes, Golang utilizes goroutines, which are similar to channels as described in CSP.]]></description>
